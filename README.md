# GoSpray
Active Directory Password Spray Testing Utility in Go

## Get it

```
git clone https://github.com/wunderwuzzi23/gospray
```

GoSpray has a dependency on ldap and gomail (via wuzziutils library). You can get those dependencies with:
```
go get github.com/wunderwuzzi23/wuzziutils
go get gopkg.in/ldap.v3
go get gopkg.in/gomail.v2
```
## Compile

Navigate to the `gospray` folder and run:

```
go build gospray.go
```

## Run

```
./gospray [options]
```

There are various command line options to specify user and password list, as well as LDAP server, certificates (when testing from non domain joined machines). Nothing fancy.

At a high level the latest version supports two testing modes:
1. **Password Spray:** If you specify both *-accounts* and *-passwords* files, then a spray will be performed
2. **Password Validation Mode:** If you specify *-validatecreds* file, the above options are ignored. The file specified with validatecreds   is parsed line by line, each line is split by colon (:) to retrieve username:password. Afterwards an authentication attempt will be performed against specified domain controller.

Usage of ./gospray:
  -accounts string
        Filename of the accounts to test. One account name per line. (default "accounts.list")
  -dc string
        URL to your LDAP Server (default "<yourdomain>.<corp>.<com>")
  -dccert string
        Public key from Domain Controller. To safely use TLS from non domain machine
  -logfile string
        Log file containing results and output (default "results.log")
  -passwords string
        Password file, one password per line. (default "passwords.list")
  -sendmail 
        Send mail when successful authentication happens (requires configuration)
  -validatecreds string
        Validation mode - single file with username,password to valdiate
  -verbose
        Verbose errors (default true)
  -workers int
        Number of concurrent worker routines (default 2)
```

## Testing from a non domain joined machine? 

When on a non-domain joined machine, it's possible to get the domain controllers cert via (basically trust on first use - tofu):
```
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect [dc].[company].[local]:636 > cer.txt
```
Afterwards the pem part of the result in a `ca.pem` file to gospray and it will use it to valide the servers certificate.

Otherwise ask your IT deparment or copy cert from your domain joined machine.

## Email Notification

To have GoSpray send emails, manually update the SMTP information in the `gospray.go` file. I haven't had the time to make that configurable via command line option


## Note

**Credential validation can cause account lockouts. Please use with care, have authorizatoin and know what you do.**



Have fun!
